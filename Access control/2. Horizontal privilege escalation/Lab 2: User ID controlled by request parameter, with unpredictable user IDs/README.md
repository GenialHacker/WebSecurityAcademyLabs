On the home page, you'll see there are lots of blog posts. Clicking on `View post` will take you to the respective blog post and show you its author. Find a post written by user `carlos`. When you hover over the username in the post it'll show you the full url at the bottom and you can see the `userId` is actually a GUID value instead of a name or number. Click on the `carlos` link and then in the url bar copy this GUID value.

Next, login as the `wiener` user and click on `My account`. In the url bar, change the `?id=` parameter with the copied GUID value of the carlos user and hit enter. You'll have access to the `carlos` user's account page.
