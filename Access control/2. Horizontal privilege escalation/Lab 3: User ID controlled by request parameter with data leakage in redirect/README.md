Login as the `wiener` user. Click on `My account` and intercept the request with Burp and send the request to repeater. On the repeater tab, change the `GET /my-account?id=wiener` to `GET /my-account?id=carlos` and send the request. In the response you'll notice that there is a 302 redirect but still the account page of the `carlos` user is shown in the response. Find the API key in the response and solve the lab challenge.
